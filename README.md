# ReactJS-NLW-LetMeAsk
This project was created by me, observing the NLW-06 ReactJS classes at Rocketseat.
The original colors were modified to become a personal project, and I implemented some validations when users access by URL, to not allow access in rooms that do not exist or are already closed.

    - cd  /letmeask
